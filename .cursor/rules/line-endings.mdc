# Line Endings

All files in this codebase must use Unix-style line endings (LF, `\n`) rather than Windows-style line endings (CRLF, `\r\n`).

## Requirements

- Use LF (`\n`) for all line endings
- Never use CRLF (`\r\n`)
- Configure your editor to use LF line endings
- Set `.gitattributes` to enforce LF line endings
- Run `git config core.autocrlf input` on your local machine

## Why?

- Ensures consistency across different operating systems
- Prevents issues with tools and build processes
- Reduces unnecessary diff changes
- Follows standard practice for modern web development

## How to Fix

If you see linter errors about `Delete ␍`, you need to:

1. Convert existing files to LF:
   ```bash
   # On Unix systems
   find . -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | xargs dos2unix
   
   # On Windows with Git Bash
   find . -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | xargs unix2dos
   ```

2. Configure Git:
   ```bash
   git config core.autocrlf input
   ```

3. Configure your editor to use LF line endings
